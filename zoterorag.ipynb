(2020) line list. For NH₃ (line list: Yurchenko et al. 2011), HCN (line list: Harris et al. 2006; Barber et al. 2014), and H₂S (line list: Rothman et al. 2013), we used the petitRADTRANS high-resolution opacity tables described in Mollière & Snellen (2019). Collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H₂–H₂ to H₂–He are also included. We fit for the abundance of H₂, though we do not include H₂ line opacity. The remaining mass of the atmosphere is assumed to be helium. As we do not include H₂ line opacity, the retrieved H₂ abundance reflects the best-fit mean molecular weight via the impact on the CIA, rather than strengths of H₂ lines in the planetary spectrum.\n",

(2023b) fixed the size of the Gaussian broadening kernel to a value found by varying the kernel size for a fixed planet model and maximizing the likelihood, in this work we set the kernel width to σ = 1.2 pixels, slightly smaller than the expected value for the instrument, and apply a rotational broadening kernel to the atmospheric forward model using the fast technique described in Carvalho & Johns-Krull (2023), which accounts for the wavelength dependence of the rotational kernel. The size of this kernel is a free parameter in the fit, allowing us to determine the best-fit line width accounting for coadd-induced LSF variations and the change in projected planetary velocity within a single coadd.\n",

            "Retrieved molecular abundances (solid lines, 1σ shaded) compared with the equilibrium abundances estimated from easychem (dashed lines). The equilibrium abundances are consistent with C/O = 0.25 and [M/H] = +0.05, both slightly below the values obtained from the gas-phase-only retrieval. The equilibrium model predicts H2S and CH4 abundances substantially greater than the retrieved upper limits. These species may be photochemically depleted.\n",

            "Similar to Finnerty et al. (2023b), we compare our retrieved abundances with the results of the equilibrium chemistry calculator easyCHEM (Mollière et al. 2017; E. Lei et al. 2023, in preparation) for the retrieved P−T profile. Figure 4 plots the equilibrium vertical abundance profiles with the constant vertical abundances from our retrievals. The retrieved CO and H2O abundances are a good match to the equilibrium predictions for C/O = 0.25 and [M/H] = 0.05, suggesting the gas-phase retrieval may be slightly overestimating the atmospheric metallicity. Both H2O and CO abundances are roughly constant with height in equilibrium, validating the constant-with-altitude assumption in our retrieval and indicating that the potential biases resulting from high-altitude H2O depletion in ultra-hot Jupiters (Brogi et al. 2023) are not a factor for HD 189733 b.\n",
            "\n",
            "The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the retrieved CH4 posterior indicates logCH4 < −4.6 with 99% confidence. However, Figure 4 indicates that in chemical equilibrium for the retrieved P−T profile, the CH4 mass fraction should be >10−4 over nearly the entire pressure range probed by the KPIC observations in order to match the retrieved H2O and CO abundances. We caution that the retrieved P−T profile in Figure 3 is somewhat colder than expected in the upper atmosphere, which may lead to an overprediction of CH4 when assuming chemical equilibrium. While previous attempts at CH4 detection in hot Jupiters have faced challenges with line list accuracy, we use an opacity table based on the recent Hargreaves et al. (2020) line list which has been validated on brown dwarfs of similar effective temperature (Tannock et al. 2022). This opacity table has also previously been used to successfully measure the CH4 abundance in a brown dwarf companion from KPIC observations at a mixing ratio comparable to that expected in HD 189733 b (Xuan et al. 2022). This suggests that the retrieved upper limit on CH4 is due to a real absence of the expected CH4, rather than a line list issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Depletion of CH4 could be due to photochemistry. We assessed this possibility using the VULCAN chemical kinetics code (Tsai et al. 2021). We used the default P−T/Kzz profile for HD 189733 b included with VULCAN and described in Tsai et al. (2021), which is slightly hotter than our retrieved profile in the upper atmosphere, the SNCHO photochemistry network, and the C/H and O/H set to the retrieved medians. All other settings were unchanged from the VULCAN defaults. VULCAN predicts a roughly constant CH4 mass fraction of ∼10−5 from pressures between approximately 1 and 10−3 bar. Over the same pressure range, the NH3 mass fraction is predicted to be ∼10−4. The abundance of both species rapidly drops above 1 mbar, which may bias the abundances obtained from a free retrieval assuming constant abundance with pressure toward lower values, similar to the impact of water depletion in the upper atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters discussed in Brogi et al. (2023).\n",
            "\n",
            "From the retrieved posterior, we obtain 99% upper limits logCH4 < −4.6 and logNH3 < −4.5, suggesting the current KPIC observations are not quite sensitive enough to make a definitive (non)detection at the VULCAN-predicted abundances. Both CH4 and NH3 have significant opacity throughout the NIR. Incorporating additional data such as high-resolution L-band observations from KPIC phase III may improve sensitivity to these species and enable tests of photochemical models in the future. Additionally, incorporating flux-calibrated, broadband medium-resolution observations from JWST would significantly improve constraints on absolute abundances compared with high-resolution observations alone, and also enable constraints on species which lack features easy to observe from the ground, such as CO2.\n",

            "While the CO isotopologue ratio is not well constrained in the retrieval, comparing the log-likelihood of the maximum-likelihood model with and without 13CO indicates the presence of 13CO is favored at ∼3σ. The marginalized posterior shows a clear preference for high levels of 13CO enrichment compared with both the solar system value of 12C/13C ∼89 and local interstellar value of 12C/13C ∼68 (Milam et al. 2005; Woods & Willacy 2009), but with a long tail that is still consistent with the interstellar value at 1σ. Previously, Finnerty et al. (2023b) and Line et al. (2021) reported indications of 13CO enrichment in hot Jupiter atmospheres compared with the local interstellar medium. These estimates are substantially less than the median retrieved for HD 189733 b, and were instead broadly consistent with the level of isotopic fractionation expected in the midplanes of protoplanetary disks (Woods & Willacy 2009).\n",
